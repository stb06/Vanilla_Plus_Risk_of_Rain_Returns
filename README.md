# Important Info
- Please don't update any of the mods if they ask you to. It can mess with the behavior of things, and possibly cause the modpack to break.
- This modpack is intended to be used with both DLC for an experience closest to Risk of Rain Returns, but works fine without.
	- Keep in mind that only the host needs to own the DLC to do multiplayer.
	- Content when using Survivors of the Void DLC
		- Adds Gup.
		- Adds Mending elite.
		- Adds all other Survivors of the Void content (other than some stages).
	- Content when using Seekers of the Storm DLC
		- Adds Child.
		- Adds skins.
		- Adds all other Seekers of the Storm content (other than one stage variant).
- If you get to Sky Meadow or Helminth Hatchery before looping, please switch the teleporter to the next stage rather than the moon.
- If you want to hear a bell when the difficulty increases, it is in the base game as an umbrella setting.
- If you download the modpack file itself, it will tell you if the modpack has an update in r2modman.
	- Look for a cloud with an arrow next to Vanilla_Plus_Risk_of_Rain_Returns to see if the modpack has an update (you can move Vanilla_Plus_Risk_of_Rain_Returns just under BepInExPack or click the "update all" button in front of the yellow box to easily see if there's an update). Install the update through the link as usual, and download Vanilla_Plus_Risk_of_Rain_Returns again. Please replace the More_OSTs_Mod folder when you update.
		- If there isn't an update to the modpack itself, simply update Vanilla_Plus_Risk_of_Rain_Returns.
- This modpack includes Starstorm2 (best if used with next 4 mods mentioned), Videogame_Mod_2_Unofficial, Survariants, NemesisSkins, NemesisRobomando, ProperSave, DiscordRichPresence, and RealerCheatUnlocks which are off by default.
	- There may be some items that are not unlockable with this modpack, so you may want to enable RealerCheatUnlocks and right click them to unlock them (namely Fireworks).
